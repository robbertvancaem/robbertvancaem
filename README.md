### Hi there 👋

I'm a creative Frontend Developer who likes to: 

- 🤔 Ask 'why' an awful lot of times
- 🤓 Do the additional backend implementation
- 🥊 Challenge each other (for example in Code Reviews)
- ⚡️ Think about improvements in the overall process (not only coding)
- 📖 Create and maintain documentation
- 🧪 Create and maintain tests
- 🎟 Create meaningful tickets and actually update them
- 🧑🏽‍🎓 Keep on learning

🌱 Currently I'm catching up on my Next.js skills
🎶 I'm into either very loud music (hardcore metal) or guilty pleasures like Taylor Swift and Katy Perry
